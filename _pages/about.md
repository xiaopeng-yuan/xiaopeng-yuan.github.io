I am currently a postdoc senior researcher at [RWTH Aachen University](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/), Germany. Previously, I received my M.Sc. degree and my Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering, information technology and computer engineering from RWTH Aachen University, respectively in 2019 with [Springorum-Medal Award](https://prorwth.de/de/projekte-und-aktivitaeten/auszeichnungen-und-ehrungen/springorum-denkmuenze/) and in Mar. 2023 with [Borchers-Medallion Award](https://prorwth.de/de/projekte-und-aktivitaeten/auszeichnungen-und-ehrungen/borchers-plakette/). Before those, I received my B.Sc. Degree in automation from Beijing University of Aeronautics & Astronautics, China, in 2016. My current research interests are in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted wireless networks, ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC), wireless power transfer (WPT) technologies and optimization techniques.
